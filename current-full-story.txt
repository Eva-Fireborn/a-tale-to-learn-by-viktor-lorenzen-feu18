There was ones..
was an evil lord.

and his even more evil pet, mr pig. the great hero John enter with a big smile and blonde styled hair look from the 70's.
The quest was to find flowers and see which one that smells most.
the trainain was was full of nothing but long flat lands..
the great obstacle was the nothingnes,
and the evil mr pig run to his master to give him his powers.
the hero john finaly wins over the flat land by walking
and so we just need to keep walking
and so all lived on as if nothing ever happened.
